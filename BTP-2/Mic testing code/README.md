MAX9814 microphone module was used for the project.<br>
The testing was done using arduino IDE on an ESP32-S3.<br>
mic_amplitude_test.ino just displays the signal amplitude on a serial monitor for quick testing.<br>
For a better test, to actually hear what is being recorded mic_hearing_test.ino was used., along with serial_to_wav.py script being run on the PC, to receive the audio samples and convert them to a playable .wav file<br>
